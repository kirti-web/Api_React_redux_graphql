# API with React and GraphQL

weâ€™ll go over some GraphQL CRUD examples to help you understand how CRUD operations work in a React and GraphQL app.

## Available Scripts

To running the app, In the project directory, you can run:

### `node index.js`

It will start the server on http://localhost:4000/graphql

We use queries and mutations to read and modify data in data-sources.

# Connecting to graphql-server

I have created a CRA boilerplate and have installed GraphQL, apollo-boost, and @apollo/react-hooks. We initialize Apollo Client and get it hooked to React.
